            <p>We need fearless daredevils to clear the mansion. Do you
                have

            <p>Here's what we know: ghosts are vulnerable to plasma that matches their color. Pink ghosts can be
                caught with
                pink plasma, blue ghosts with blue plasma, and so on.</p>
            <p>You'll be equipped with a plasma shooter capable of firing two-cell bullets. Your mission is to guide
                these
                bullets so they release plasma upon colliding with obstacles - ghosts or other plasma.</p>
            <p>To catch a ghost, you'll need to align at least three plasma cells of the same color in a row â€” either
                horizontally or vertically.</p>
            <p>But that's not all! You'll also receive two special bullets with unique abilities to help you on your
                journey. Use them wisely!</p>
